    "n Python, an exception is a type of error that occurs during the execution of a program.\n",
    "Exceptions can occur for a variety of reasons, such as invalid input, memory errors, \n",
    "or network connectivity issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception occurs, Python raises an exception object, which contains information\n",
    "about the error, such as the type of exception, the line number where the error occurred,\n",
    "and a traceback of the function calls leading up to the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "A syntax error, on the other hand, is a type of error that occurs when the Python interpreter\n",
    "is unable to parse a program due to a syntax violation. In other words, a syntax error occurs\n",
    "when the code you've written does not conform to the rules of the Python language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that exceptions occur during the \n",
    "execution of a program, whereas syntax errors occur during the parsing of the code. When a\n",
    "syntax error occurs, the Python interpreter is unable to execute any of the code in the program,\n",
    "whereas when an exception occurs, Python can continue to execute the program, provided that the\n",
    "exception is handled correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a syntax error and an exception in Python:\n",
    "    # Syntax error\n",
    "print(\"Hello, world!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exception\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    a = 5 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "In the above code, the first line contains a syntax error because the closing parenthesis is\n",
    "      missing from the print() function call. This error will prevent the program from executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of the code contains an exception, where we attempt to divide 5 by 0. Since \n",
    "this operation is not allowed, a ZeroDivisionError is raised, but the program continues \n",
    "to execute because we catch and handle the exception with a try/except block.\n",
